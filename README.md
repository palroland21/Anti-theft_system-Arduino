The presented project consists of a motion monitoring system based on the Arduino ESP32 platform.
The main application of this system is object security. It is a useful device for home or business security, helping to safeguard valuable objects.

The project utilizes sensors and general-purpose electronic components, configured in a user-friendly manner. Developing this project provides an opportunity to learn how 
programming interacts with sensors,aiming to implement a real-world solution using the ESP32 board.

The documentation (.docx) includes both a photo of the system's physical components — such as the sensors and the board — and an image of the source code.
